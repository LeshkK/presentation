### Hi, my name is Vlad and I would like to tell you about Google Analytics. 

Google Analytics is a useful tool for collecting statistics, this is a special kind of counter from Google, which is first provided to analyze the traffic of Your site, assess the behavior of Your user, check the sources of visits to Your site, track what goals have been achieved by users of Your site, what stages of the visit, and much more. In other words, installing a Google Analytics counter gives you the ability to understand – who, when and why visited your site. Full analysis of the target audience allows you to quickly respond to user requests.

The Google site visit counter is code written in JavaScript. This is a free service, the tool generates a lot of reports, on the basis of which you can create a strategy for website promotion.

## How Google Analytics works

So, Let's imagine that a user comes to your site, you have already connected the Google Analytics code, and now, when user visit your site in a special cookie file the Analytics system records information about your user, after which Google begins to collect data about this particular user. How many and which pages he looked, how long he was present on these pages, what he did on them, what photos he opened, what links he clicked, whether he clicked on the buttons and more. All this data is sent directly to Google's servers, where it is processed and shown to us in the form of a Google Analytics report. In these reports you will see trends in different directions. Trends is a diagram that goes up. By studying these trends and reports, you will be able to make some assumptions and improve your site. 

So, here's how it approximately works.

We have installed Google Analytics on the site, it gives some indicators, for example 
1.	It gave us that we have a trend, a diagram that is going up.

2.	On the basis of this trend, we build an assumption about what affect the improvement of indicators. 

3.	After that, we test this assumption on some small sections of the site, or sections of the page, and check our assumption. 

4.	After that, we analyze and check everything.

5.	And last, and most importantly, we implement all this in our system, on our website, our landing page. After that look for a new trend + follow the current trend. 

This can happen infinitely. 

## Three basic parameters of Google Analytics

Google Analytics stores data in three categories:

1.	User – data about all users who came to your site. 

2.	Session – what the user did on your site, how much time he spent on the site, what pages he viewed and more. The session may not necessarily be a visit that ended with a buy, it may also be a refusal, that is, the user came in, he did not like it, and he closed your site. 

3.	Hits – what makes the user to your website, which buttons he pressed, where did he go, are all the forms filled out, paid for its buy and so on. 
All Analytics is based on these three parameters. It's viewing length, viewing depth, bounce, multi-channel sequence and more.
